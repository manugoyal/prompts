I would like you to give me alternatives for some exercises. The alternatives
should target/stretch the same muscles, but just be a different exercise. To
generate the alternatives, find all exercises in `workout_data_export.json`
whose description aligns with the description for the given exercise. Then pick
around 5 that are similar but different.

Output just a list of exercise names in exactly the form they are present in the
doc. No extra description or fluff. Just a list of names, for each exercise.
